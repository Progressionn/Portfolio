                <h1>Reflective Essay on My Minor Experience</h1>
    
    <div class="intro">
        <p>As an aspiring English language teacher in international schools, this Minor has equipped me with foundational pedagogical tools while revealing areas for growth. My long-term plan is to work as an English teacher in international schools while also developing as an educational content creator. This dual path appeals to me because it combines classroom interaction with creative freedom, allowing me to impact learners both directly and through digital platforms basing on experiential learning, which aligns with modern communicative approaches.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Educational Practices</h2>
    <p>During the Minor, I learned several effective educational scenarios that will help me achieve my goals. Three key practices I have adopted are:</p>
    <ol style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 15px;">
        <li><span class="highlight">Task-Based Learning</span> from Didactics, where I designed a giving directions role-play observing immediate student engagement;</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Scaffolding techniques</span> from Educational Psychology, helping me break down complex grammar into digestible steps during peer teaching;</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Peer Feedback Systems from Classroom Assessment</span> where I studied about "delayed feedback" and "correction on the spot" techniques. </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Professional Strengths</h2>
    <p>My strengths include:</p>
    <ol style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 15px;">
        <li><span class="highlight">Cultural sensitivity</span> from volunteering with multilingual learners, allowing me to spot linguistic interference patterns;</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Adaptive design of the content</span> with the help of which I can modify the materials for different proficiency levels;</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Technology integration</span>, which supports vocabulary and grammar reviews with notably higher retention rates compared to traditional methods.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Professional Development Plan</h2>

            <th>Areas to work on</th>
            <th>What I'm going to do</th>

            <td>I aim to create a more dynamic and accessible learning environment. Technology will help me automate routine tasks like grading and attendance, freeing up time for personalized instruction. Additionally, interactive tools will boost student engagement by catering to diverse learning styles. With data analytics, I can track progress in real time and refine my teaching strategies to better support each student’s growth.</td>

            <td>To cultivate deeper learning, I will design classroom discussions that encourage students to take the lead.</td>
			<td>Through methods like Socratic seminars, peer debates, and open-ended questioning, I will create a space where students actively engage with ideas, challenge perspectives, and collaborate. This shift from teacher-led to student-driven discourse strengthens critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving skills. By empowering students to guide conversations, I help them develop confidence in expressing their thoughts while fostering a more inclusive and participatory classroom culture.</td>
          
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Precision Feedback</strong></td>
            <td>I will use structured rubrics, AI-assisted tools, and targeted verbal/written feedback to give students specific, actionable insights on their work.</td>
			<td>This approach ensures that students not only understand their strengths and weaknesses but also know exactly how to improve. Consistent and objective feedback fosters a growth mindset, shifting the focus from grades to skill development. By providing specific guidance, I can help students take ownership of their progress and build confidence in their abilities.</td>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This Minor has transformed my theoretical knowledge into practical skills, particularly in lesson planning and student engagement.

        <li><strong>Referencing</strong> enhances the text's cohesion by connecting ideas and providing continuity.<br>
            <strong>Anaphoric reference</strong><br>
            - "<span class="underline">It</span> (sauerkraut) is full of vitamins A, B, C and necessary microelements."<br>

        <li><strong>Ellipsis</strong> involves the omission of words or phrases that can be inferred from the context. It helps maintain a concise and fluent writing style.<br>
            "And just listen to the crunch! (It's) Like music to your ears."</li>

    <h2>6. Potential problems with syntactic features</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5px"><strong>Tense:</strong> <em>Present Continuous</em> ('...when you're having guests around')</p>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
        <li><span class="underline">Meaning</span>: a pre-intermediate student might not feel the context of an ongoing/background action and does not understand the reasons for using Present Continuous;</li>
        <li><span class="underline">Form</span>: a student of a pre-intermediate level or lower might use Present Simple tense (*when you have guests around), basing their choice on the knowledge that stative words are usually not used in progressive aspect;</li>
        <li><span class="underline">Meaning</span>: considering the point mentioned above, students should be informed that some verbs can occur in the progressive aspect with a difference in meaning. For instance, 'have' can be used in Present Continuous not with a meaning of 'possession' but referring to some action or experience;</li>
        <li><span class="underline">Pronunciation</span>: pre-intermediate students might pronounce a full form of pronoun and auxiliary verb instead of a contraction (/juː ɑːr/ vs. /jər/).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5px"><strong>Clauses</strong>: a relative dependent clause ('Who said it's one apple a day that keeps the doctor away?')</p>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
        <li><span class="underline">Punctuation</span>: intermediate students might not distinguish a defining relative clause (information cannot be omitted, no commas needed) from a non-defining one (information is not necessary, commas needed). That is why, here they can put a comma or make mistakes in other cases where it is difficult to determine the type of clause.</li>
        <li><span class="underline">Punctuation</span>: relative pronoun <em>that</em> does not require the usage of commas. Probably, some students of lower levels can make mistakes not realizing that;</li>
        <li><span class="underline">Form</span> of a verb: a relative pronoun <em>that</em> is not explicitly marked in terms of a number and pre-intermediate students can omit -s affix in verb since they do not match the pronoun with the word in singular number (*that keep the doctor away);</li>
        <li><span class="underline">Form</span>: intermediate level students can put this relative pronoun in the sentences all the time since they might lack the knowledge of the fact that relative pronoun <em>that</em> can be omitted without any change to the meaning.</li>

            <td>
                <strong>Meaning:</strong> how heavy something or someone is; any object that is heavy; the quality of being heavy; a unit or system of units used for expressing how much an object weighs etc.<br>

            </td>
            <td>
                <strong>Pronunciation:</strong> Beginner students can struggle with pronouncing the combination of letters G, H, and T in this word. Even though this combination results in a single sound /t/, students might try to pronounce all the letters in the word - /weɪght/.<br><br>
                Additionally, beginner students can pronounce the voiced bilabial /w/ sound as the fricative labiodental sound /v/ or have difficulties with the diphthong /eɪ/, if those are not present in their first language.<br><br>
                <strong>Spelling:</strong> Students unfamiliar with this word might spell it as 'weit' (again, because of the 'ght' combination and its pronunciation) or even 'wait' because of the word's homophone, 'wait'.<br><br>
                <strong>Grammar:</strong> This word can be both countable and uncountable depending on what it means in context. When 'weight' is synonymous to 'heaviness', it is uncountable and, for example, cannot be used with 'many' or have a plural form. However, the plural form 'weights' is acceptable when in context it means 'any object that is heavy, especially one lifted or thrown for exercise'.

            </td>
            <td>
                <strong>Pronunciation:</strong> ESL students can have problems with the 'ai' combination in this word and pronounce it as /sæd/, like in the word 'sad'. If they are familiar with diphthongs, students might pronounce 'said' as /seɪd/, similar to words 'laid' and 'maid' because it is a more common pronunciation of 'ai' in English words.<br><br>
                <strong>Spelling:</strong> Due to the word's pronunciation and its homophone 'sad', students might spell it as 'sad' or 'sed'.<br><br>
                <strong>Use with prepositions:</strong> Many students confuse 'say' in all of its forms and 'tell' when they construct sentences. Consequently, they can try to omit the necessary preposition 'to' and say 'said her' instead of 'said to her' or 'told her'.

            </td>
            <td>
                <strong>Pronunciation:</strong> The 'cious' part is used in only a handful of words in English, and therefore, elementary and intermediate students can struggle with pronouncing it. They can opt to say /dɪˈlɪsɪɒs/, /dɪˈlɪkəs/ or something else. The first 'e' also may cause mistakes because it requires a long /ɪ/ sound, as in 'big', instead of /e/, as in 'deli' (/ˈdel.i/).<br><br>
                <strong>Spelling:</strong> This word can be incorrectly spelt as 'delishes', 'delishos', 'delishis' because of its pronunciation.<br><br>
                <strong>Grammar:</strong> 'Delicious' is usually identified as an extreme non-gradable adjective. Thus pairing it with 'very' or 'really', which ESL students may do, is not recommended.

            <td>
                <p>When forming both <strong>affirmative</strong> and <strong>negative</strong> statements it is more natural to use a contraction (e.g. <strong>affirmative</strong> form: we'll = we will, he'll = he will; <strong>negative</strong> form: won't).</p>
                
                <p>In natural speech words connect smoothly:</p>
                <p><strong>If_we have time, we'll see our friends.</strong> (<span class="phonetic">[ɪf wɪ hæv]</span> -- sounds linked).</p>
                
                <p>Weak pronunciation of have/has in if-clause: <strong>if we have time</strong> → <span class="phonetic">[ɪf wɪ həv taɪm]</span> (the h in "have/has" may disappear).</p>
                
                <p><strong>If</strong> often links smoothly with the subject that follows it:</p>
                <p>(e.g. <strong>If we</strong> → <span class="phonetic">[ɪfwi]</span>;<br>
                <strong>If you</strong> → <span class="phonetic">[ɪfju]</span>;<br>
                <strong>If I</strong> → <span class="phonetic">[ɪfaɪ]</span>;<br>

                <p>In the <strong>affirmative</strong> statements intonation usually falls in the if-clause and rises in the main clause (If we have time ↘, we'll see our friends ↗).</p>
                
                <p>When a question starts with <strong>"will"</strong>, intonation rises first and then falls:</p>

                <p><strong>Solution 1</strong>: clarify that the first Conditional expresses <strong>probability,</strong> rather than <strong>certainty</strong> by providing additional examples where the first Conditional is used.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Problem 2</strong>: students may assume that "<strong>if</strong>" always indicates a first Conditional sentence, even though "<strong>if</strong>" can also be used outside of the first Conditional (<strong>e.g.</strong> If you want, you can join us).</p>
                <p><strong>Solution 2</strong>: writing on the board two sentences that illustrate differences in the use of "<strong>if</strong>" in the first Conditional and in other contexts and explain differences in meaning.</p>
                <p>e.g. <strong>If</strong> you study hard, you will pass the exam.<br>

                <p><strong>Solution 3</strong>: write examples with the first Conditional on the board and mark <strong>relationships</strong> between the clauses (<strong>e.g.</strong> drawing arrows from if-clause to the main clause).</p>

                <p><strong>Solution 1</strong>: practice the same sentence with different subjects in order to prevent mistakes such as forgetting to change the form of the verb in if-clause (<strong>e.g.</strong> pay attention to sentences with <strong>he/she</strong> subjects where ending <strong>-s</strong> is necessary).</p>

                <p><strong>Solution 1</strong>: highlight on the board one more time the difference between the pronunciation of <strong>we will</strong> and <strong>we'll</strong> and give students more exercises to reinforce their memory. <span class="phonetic">[wi wɪl] [wiːl]</span></p>
                
                <p><strong>Problem 2</strong>: the word "<strong>if</strong>" might be pronounced unclearly or not linked properly with the next word.</p>

                     <div class="project-title" style ="font-size:20px">"Giving Directions While Traveling"</div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h2>Step 1: Identify Your Learner Group</h2>
        <p><span class="highlight">Age:</span> 18-25 years old (young adults)</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Level:</span> Pre-intermediate-intermediate (A2-B1)</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Number of students:</span> 14 (working in pairs)</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">Interests:</span> Travel, city exploration, navigation, and interactive communication.</p>
        
        <p>This age group is chosen for this project because young adults in this range often travel independently or plan trips abroad, making giving and understanding directions a highly practical skill. At the A2-B1 level, students can form basic sentences but usually struggle with fluency, logical sequencing, and natural linking phrases — key elements this project targets.</p>
        
        <p>The task is designed for pair work (7 pairs total) to maximize speaking time and peer interaction. Since each dialogue will last approximately 1-2 minutes, even with 7 pairs, there will be enough time for feedback and discussion.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h2>Step 2: Project Theme, Task & Final Product</h2>
        <p>The project's theme is going to be "Giving Directions While Traveling". The project focuses on giving and understanding directions in English. This topic was chosen because it aligns with the real-life needs of students, who, as young adults, may travel, study abroad, or interact with tourists in their own cities. After learning key vocabulary items (e.g., turn left, go straight, it's next to) and practicing simple directions in class, students will apply their skills in a pair role-play activity.</p>
        
        <p>Each pair will receive different scenario cards: one student plays a lost tourist, and the other acts as a helpful local. They must create a 1-2 minute dialogue where the tourist asks for directions to a landmark (e.g., a train station, museum, or café), and the local responds using clear, step-by-step instructions with linking words (e.g., First, Then, Finally). After all pairs perform, the class will vote on the clearest and most natural-sounding directions, reinforcing practical communication skills.</p>
        
        <p>The final product (a spoken dialogue) mirrors real-world interactions, building confidence for travel. This task encourages active listening, as students must react to their partner's directions (e.g., "Sorry, could you repeat that?"). The competitive element (voting) keeps the activity engaging and interactive.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h2>Step 3: Learning Outcomes</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5px">By the end of the project, students will be able to:</p>
        <ul style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
            <li>Give clear directions using linking phrases (First, Next, Then, Finally).</li>
            <li>Ask for directions politely ("Excuse me, how do I get to...?").</li>
            <li>Understand and follow spoken directions.</li>
            <li>Role-play a travel scenario naturally.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>By practicing these skills, students will develop real-world communicative competence for travel situations while improving their fluency. The role-play format encourages quick thinking and adaptation, mirroring authentic interactions where directions might need to be simplified or repeated. Additionally, this activity will help students build cultural awareness — students learn that giving directions varies across countries (e.g., landmarks vs. street names in some cultures). The collaborative nature of pair work also fosters patience and teamwork, as students must listen carefully and support each other's learning.</p>

        <h2>Step 4: Assessment Criteria</h2>
        <ul style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
            <li>Clarity of directions (logical sequence).</li>
            <li>Use of linking phrases (e.g., First, Then, Finally).</li>
            <li>Pronunciation & fluency (no long pauses).</li>
            <li>The correct use of prepositions ("Turn left at the..." vs. "Turn left on the...").</li>
            <li>Engagement (natural tone, eye contact).</li>
            <li>Following the time limit (no more than 2 minutes).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h2>Step 5: Equipment Needed</h2>
        <ul style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
            <li>Printed location cards (Tourist & Local versions).</li>
            <li>City map visuals (e.g., Tokyo, Rome, etc.).</li>
            <li>Whiteboard and markers (for modeling directions).</li>
            <li>Timer (for dialogue practice).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h2>Step 6: Support Needed</h2>
        <ul style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
            <li>Vocabulary on the topic of travelling which will be used in the dialogue.</li>
            <li>Pre-teach direction phrases ("Go straight," "Turn left/right," "It's next to...").</li>
            <li>Review linking words (First, Next, After that, Finally).</li>
            <li>Model a sample dialogue.</li>
            <li>Allow rehearsal time before performing.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h2>Step 7: Model Dialogue (Procedure)</h2>
        <p>I will begin by demonstrating a sample dialogue between a tourist and a local, showing the format students should follow.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5px">After that I will highlight the features to which students should pay attention while completing the task:</p>
        
        <ul style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
            <li><span class="highlight">Structure:</span> Clear sequencing with linking words (First, Then, After that, Finally).</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Landmarks:</span> Using visible reference points (fountain, supermarket, park).</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Polite language:</span> "Excuse me," "Of course," "You can't miss it".</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Prepositions:</span> "along," "onto," "on your left/right".</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Natural flow:</span> No long pauses, conversational tone.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>After modeling, I will ask students to identify these features in the sample dialogue and explain why each is important for clear directions. We will then practice chorally repeating key phrases before students create their own dialogues. This will help ensure everyone understands the expectations before beginning pair work.</p>

        or Spanish) in authentic, interactive scenarios. By engaging with diverse cultural
        traditions, music, and customs, participants will naturally develop their listening and
        speaking skills while expanding their vocabulary related to travel, cuisine, and social
        interactions. The activities are carefully structured to align with CEFR levels A2-B2,
        ensuring accessibility for intermediate learners while offering enough challenge to
        keep advanced students engaged. This festival represents our school’s commitment
        to fostering not just linguistic proficiency but also genuine cultural appreciation and
        global citizenship.</p>
        
        <h2>Description of the event</h2>
        <p>The Global Fusion Festival transforms our school into a bustling multicultural hub
        through four interactive activity stations. At the Language Café, students will practice
        ordering food in their target language from country-themed booths representing
        France, Mexico, Great Britain and others. The Music & Dance Challenge station
        invites participants to learn short song lyrics or dance moves while discovering
        cultural context. For creative writing practice, the Postcard Exchange allows students
        to compose messages to fictional characters using newly-learned cultural facts.
        Perhaps most exciting is the Debate Zone, where learners discuss lighthearted
        topics like "Is pizza a sandwich?" entirely in their target language. Throughout the
        event, students collect passport stamps at each station, working toward prizes while
        naturally reinforcing their language skills. Optional cultural dress-up (berets,
        sombreros, etc.) and a special guest speaker session with a local expat sharing
        travel stories add to the immersive experience.</p>

        <h2>Target Student Group</h2>
        <p>This festival is ideally suited for:</p>
        <ul style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
            <li>Language learners at CEFR levels A2 (Pre-Intermediate) to B2
            (Upper-Intermediate);</li>
            <li>Students aged 12-18 (though easily adaptable for adult learners);</li>
            <li>Classes focusing on general language acquisition or specific exam preparation
            (IELTS, DELF, etc.);</li>
            <li>Students who benefit from kinesthetic and social learning styles;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The activities are designed to be inclusive yet challenging enough to push students
        slightly beyond their comfort zones in a supportive environment.</p>
        
        <h2>Purpose of the event</h2>
        <p>The Global Fusion Festival serves three primary objectives:</p>
        <p><strong>Linguistic Development:</strong> By removing classroom walls, students practice
        spontaneous communication through unscripted interactions like food ordering and
        informal debates, significantly improving fluency and listening comprehension.</p>
        <p><strong>Cultural Enrichment:</strong> Exposure to diverse traditions through music, cuisine and
        customs fosters genuine intercultural understanding that textbooks cannot provide.</p>
        <p><strong>Social-Emotional Growth:</strong> The low-pressure, game-like atmosphere helps reduce
        language anxiety while collaborative tasks build teamwork and public speaking
        confidence.</p>
        <p>These goals align perfectly with modern language pedagogy emphasizing
        communicative competence and intercultural awareness.</p>

After finishing school, she continued studying English at the university and also took an additional English course with the private tutor for two years aimed at developing her general English skills as well as practicing English in the area of economy which was quite beneficial for her job.</p>
                    
                    <p>The major reason for learning English was a need to use it in the professional settings: since Helen is a Manager of Sale Department she should be able to explain the delivery conditions to her clients. Now Helen's motivation is mainly extrinsical because she uses English primarily for the purposes of her job. Sometimes she exposes herself to the natural English environment: she likes watching videos that are aligned with her hobbies and many of these videos are designed in English, that's why learning general English is of her interest.</p>
                    
                    <p>Regarding the type of intelligence Helen is an intrapersonal learner since she prefers to have a deep and accurate understanding of the self and possesses a high degree of self-confidence and self-efficacy. For this reason, she doesn't like group activities and role-plays. Helen prefers TBL approach since she can practice to solve real-life tasks that are applicable for her job and use English for performing particular tasks.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5px">1)<strong> Main:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5px">We would like to develop people's ability of transforming the world around them into the different feelings and harmony</p>
        <p>Also, we want to motivate peers by showing the beauty of the surroundings and breaking them away from reality. Moreover, our lesson is a great chance to get acquainted with and remember the best works of art, thinking about the topic.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5px">2)<strong> Subsidiary:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>One of the subsidiary aims is "establishing the level of the knowledge on the topic". Another one is "systematizing the type of art, the year and the country".</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5px">3)<strong> Personal:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>According to the personal aims we are going to develop respect for the art of your homeland. Furthermore, we see that worldview development is significant as it helps to prevent the society from anxiety.</p>

    <p><span class="mark">nationalities: mainly Russian students</span></p>
    <p><span class="mark">motivation: highly-motivated students (interested in practicing peer-teaching because it is a task for everyone, and it is assessed. According to the topic, there are some students who are keen on art in a group, while others will be motivated to listen to the lesson by our team)</span></p>
    <p><span class="mark">interests: not everyone is interested and have already faced paintings, but we believe that art is one of the inalienable parts of our life, so it seems to us that knowing the most famous paintings is important.</span></p>
    <p><span class="mark">class dynamics: we have an opportunity only to guess, because there is the first lesson on this topic within this group and we have no ideas of the "starting point" of each student. However, it will be seen during in our lesson( while traveling all over the world on a map and guessing famous paintings)</span></p>

    <h2><span class="mark">Experience and skills:</span></h2>
    <p><span class="mark"><span class="underline">What language do you expect students to know that you are (not) planning to teach?</span></span></p>

    <p><span class="mark"><span class="underline">What art paintings do you expect students to know that you are (not) planning to teach?</span></span></p>
    <p><span class="mark">It is great if students are familiar with art, but the aim of the lesson to face with this topic all students even in case they see these paintings at the first time.(We hope the "first" and NOT "the last" in our case)</span></p>
    <p><strong>There is no specific answer for this question, the list of famous artworks with which students are supposed to be familiar with.</strong></p>
    <p><span class="mark"><span class="underline">What language items have students looked at in previous classes that are relevant to your aims?</span></span></p>
    <p><span class="mark">The previous peer-teaching lesson our colleagues presented was about anxiety.</span></p>
    <p><span class="mark">We find it really helpful for our topic and aims, because art can cope with this feeling or, the opposite- cause it. Our students will be able to reduce stress and feel comfortable in harmony using art too.</span></p>

    <h2><span class="mark">Assumption</span>:</h2>
    <p><span class="mark">Students' interest/general knowledge in relation to the material/context?</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="mark">We think that students have faced with art at schools: there were drawing lesson (art) and world artistic cultures(in Russian: "МХК"- Мировая художественная культура) where they were taught paintings.</span></p>
